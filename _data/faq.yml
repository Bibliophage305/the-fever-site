- question: Do you have your own PA and lighting?
  answer: |
    We bring our standard PA and lights to every show at no extra cost. 
    If you already have a suitable sound system we're happy to use it,
    but if you don't, then you don't need to hire any extra equipment
    for us.

- question: How long do you play for?
  answer: |
    We usually play for a total of two hours, split into two hour-long
    sets. We also offer an extra hour-long acoustic set, ideal for a
    drinks reception or cocktail hour.

- question: What happens before/between/after your sets?
  answer: |
    Anything you like! We can play pre-mixed playlists - either ours or
    something you send us in advance - or hand over to your DJ. We also
    offer a DJ upgrade, where a band member will select and mix tracks
    as well as take requests.

- question: Can you play outside?
  answer: |
    So long you can provide power (and a plan B in case of inclement
    weather), we can play anywhere you'd like us.

- question: How far will you travel?
  answer: |
    We play a lot around the South of England, but we often travel much
    further afield. We're happy to put together a quote to play anywhere
    in the UK (or the world!)

- question: How long do you take to set up?
  answer: |
    We prefer to have 90 minutes between the earliest time we can have
    access to the performance space and the start of our performance.

- question: Can you provide music for our wedding ceremony/drinks reception/cocktail hour?
  answer: |
    Yes! Get in touch with us and we'll work with you to build a bespoke
    package, including acoustic solo, duo, or trio sets.

- question: Do you take requests?
  answer: |
    We are happy to perform one special request for you - for weddings
    this is usually the first dance. You can also let us know your top
    10 preferences from our repertoire, as well as send up to 30
    requests for the disco, so you can be sure to hear all your
    favourites on the evening.

- question: Our venue has a noise limiter, can we still book you?
  answer: |
    We're highly experienced in dealing with noise limiters, and we
    usually don't have a problem with them. That said we are a loud rock
    band so please put us in contact with your venue and we'll make sure
    we have all of the relevant information to plan around it.

- question: Do you have Public Liability Insurance and PAT tested equipment?
  answer: Yes, we're happy to provide certificates on request.

- question: Do we need to provide food and drinks?
  answer: |
    Our standard rider is soft drinks and a hot meal for each musician,
    or a Â£15pp buyout.

- question: How much space do you need?
  answer: |
    We have fit in some very tight spaces, but we look and sound best
    when we have at least 2.5m by 5m.

- question: How much power do you need?
  answer: Two standard 13A sockets is usually fine.

- question: We have something unique planned, can we talk to you about how you can fit into our vision for the event?
  answer: |
    We'd love to hear from you! Use our contact form or email us at
    info@thefever.band to talk to us about what we can do for
    your event. We can accommodate most requests, and in the rare cases
    that we can't help, we'll refer you to someone who can.
