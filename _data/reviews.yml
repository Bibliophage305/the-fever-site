    - The Fever brought the heat!
    - When we decided to have a wedding, we wanted something original and fun and that will keep everyone engaged and entertained, so we asked The Fever to host our bandeoke reception. 
    - And what a great decision that was. The band was epic, they set up and did their sound check quickly and without anyone noticing, the musicians are very polite and friendly, and extremely talented. They catered to our every ask, and kept people on the dance floor all night. The queue for the bandeoke was insane, and there was a plethora of songs to choose from. One of my favourites that the band played was "Kiss" by Prince, such a difficult song to pull off but they did it beautifully. I also requested a special song to sing as I opened the bandeoke part of the night, and while it is not in their portfolio, they learned it, sang it with me and it was a hit.
    - Thank you so much for making our wedding day a wonderful and fun experience, and good luck on all of your future endeavours.
